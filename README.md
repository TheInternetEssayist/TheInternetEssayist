A chill freelancer writer who kinda knows how to code...? 📚

Alright in HTML, JS and learning C#. Incorporating writing into my designs, feel free to hit me up for collaborations! 🙌

Likes Genshin Impact and short, packed writing. They often coincide in my writing, which serves well to get my creative juices flowing. Also, emergency food 🥄

Thanks for stopping by, I suppose? 🍹
