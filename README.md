A chill freelancer writer who kinda knows how to code...? ðŸ“š

Alright in HTML, JS and learning C#. Incorporating writing into my designs, feel free to hit me up for collaborations! ðŸ™Œ

Likes Genshin Impact and short, packed writing. They often coincide in my writing, which serves well to get my creative juices flowing. Also, emergency food ðŸ¥„

Thanks for stopping by, I suppose?
